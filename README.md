# 🚀 DBT SQL Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for different SQL tasks built with **DBT** on top of **Snowflake**.  
All the core solutions can be found in the **`models/solutions/`** folder, this is the main place to explore when reviewing my work.

## 📌 Naming Convention

I have followed a consistent naming pattern to keep solutions organized and easy to navigate:

- **t1** → Task 1  
- **t2** → Task 2  
- **q1, q2, q3...** → Question numbers  

Example:  
`t1_q4_interesting_info.sql` → Task 1, Question 4.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Snowflake** → Data warehouse. Here the actually is actually stored and compute happens.
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)** → Modeling and transformations  
- **SQL** → Querying and analysis  
- *(Optional)* **Power BI** → Used to visualize insights

## 📈 Lineage Graphs

DBT also provides lineage graphs to show how staging tables flow into final solution models.
